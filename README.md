- 👋 Hi, I’m @willbaker29
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics and programming; particulary Python and microcontrollers in C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a couple of projects to refine my Python and C++ skills, as well as developing my knowledge in network infrastructure with a homelab.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help develop my own skills.
